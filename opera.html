          <h4 class="pooh name">POOH.</h4><p class="pooh speech">Now though you'd have said that head was dead</p>
          <p class="direction">(For its owner dead was he),</p>
          <p class="pooh speech">
            It stood on its neck, with a smile well-bred,
                 And bowed three times to me!
            It was none of your impudent off-hand nods,
                 But as humble as could be;
                      For it clearly knew
                      The deference due
                 To a man of pedigree!
                      And it's oh, I vow,
                      This deathly bow
                 Was a touching sight to see;
                      Though trunkless, yet
                      It couldn't forget
                 The deference due to me!
          </p>
          <p class="song">CHORUS.
                      This haughty youth,
                      He speaks the truth
                 Whenever he finds it pays:
                      And in this case
                      It all took place
                 Exactly as he says!

               All this is very interesting, and I should like to have seen it.  But we came about a totally different matter. A year ago my son, the heir to the throne of Japan, bolted from our Imperial Court.

          <h4 class="ko name">KO.</h4><p class="ko speech">Indeed!  Had he any reason to be dissatisfied with his position?</p>
          <h4 class="kat name">KAT.</h4><p class="kat speech">None whatever.  On the contrary, I was going to marry him—yet he fled!</p>
          <h4 class="pooh name">POOH.</h4><p class="pooh speech">I am surprised that he should have fled from one so lovely!</p>

               You hold that I am not beautiful because my face is
               plain.  But you know nothing; you are still unenlightened.
               Learn, then, that it is not in the face alone that beauty is to
               be sought.  My face is unattractive!

               But I have a left shoulder-blade that is a miracle of
               loveliness.  People come miles to see it.  My right elbow has a
               fascination that few can resist.
