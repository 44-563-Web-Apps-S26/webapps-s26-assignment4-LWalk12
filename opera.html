    <p>
        POOH.     Now though you'd have said that head was dead
                 (For its owner dead was he),
            It stood on its neck, with a smile well-bred,
                 And bowed three times to me!
            It was none of your impudent off-hand nods,
                 But as humble as could be;
                      For it clearly knew
                      The deference due
                 To a man of pedigree!
                      And it's oh, I vow,
                      This deathly bow
                 Was a touching sight to see;
                      Though trunkless, yet
                      It couldn't forget
                 The deference due to me!

                                 CHORUS.

                      This haughty youth,
                      He speaks the truth
                 Whenever he finds it pays:
                      And in this case
                      It all took place
                 Exactly as he says!
                                                              [Exeunt
  Chorus.

       MIK.  All this is very interesting, and I should like to
  have seen it.  But we came about a totally different matter.  A
  year ago my son, the heir to the throne of Japan, bolted from our
  Imperial Court.
       KO.  Indeed!  Had he any reason to be dissatisfied with his
  position?
       KAT.  None whatever.  On the contrary, I was going to marry
  him—yet he fled!
       POOH.  I am surprised that he should have fled from one so
  lovely!
       KAT.  That's not true.
       POOH.  No!
       KAT.  You hold that I am not beautiful because my face is
  plain.  But you know nothing; you are still unenlightened.
  Learn, then, that it is not in the face alone that beauty is to
  be sought.  My face is unattractive!
       POOH.  It is.
       KAT.  But I have a left shoulder-blade that is a miracle of
  loveliness.  People come miles to see it.  My right elbow has a
  fascination that few can resist.
       POOH.  Allow me!
       KAT.  It is on view Tuesdays and Fridays, on presentation of
  visiting card.  As for my circulation, it is the largest in the
  world.
       KO.  And yet he fled!
       MIK.  And is now masquerading in this town, disguised as a
  Second Trombone.
       KO., POOH., and PITTI.  A Second Trombone!
       MIK.  Yes; would it be troubling you too much if I asked you
  to produce him?  He goes by the name of——
       KAT.  Nanki-Poo.
       MIK.  Nanki-Poo.
       KO.  It's quite easy.  That is, it's rather difficult.  In
  point of fact, he's gone abroad!
       MIK.  Gone abroad!  His address.
       KO.  Knightsbridge!
       KAT.  (who is reading certificate of death).  Ha!
       MIK.  What's the matter?
       KAT.  See here—his name—Nanki-Poo—beheaded this morning.
  Oh, where shall I find another?  Where shall I find another?

                        [Ko-Ko, Pooh-Bah, and Pitti-Sing fall on
  their knees.
