    <h1>Lane Walker -- Light Opera</h1>

    <h2>The Mikado</h2>
    <h3>ACT II -- SCENE-Ko-Ko's Garden</h3>

          <h4>POOH.</h4><p>Now though you'd have said that head was dead</p>
          <p>(For its owner dead was he),</p>
          <p>
            It stood on its neck, with a smile well-bred,
                 And bowed three times to me!
            It was none of your impudent off-hand nods,
                 But as humble as could be;
                      For it clearly knew
                      The deference due
                 To a man of pedigree!
                      And it's oh, I vow,
                      This deathly bow
                 Was a touching sight to see;
                      Though trunkless, yet
                      It couldn't forget
                 The deference due to me!
          CHORUS.
                      This haughty youth,
                      He speaks the truth
                 Whenever he finds it pays:
                      And in this case
                      It all took place
                 Exactly as he says!
          </p>
          <p>[Exeunt Chorus].</p>

          <h4>MIK.</h4><p>
               All this is very interesting, and I should like to have seen it.  But we came about a totally different matter. A year ago my son, the heir to the throne of Japan, bolted from our Imperial Court.
          </p>
          <h4>KO.</h4><p>Indeed!  Had he any reason to be dissatisfied with his position?</p>
          <h4>KAT.</h4><p>None whatever.  On the contrary, I was going to marry him—yet he fled!</p>
          <h4>POOH.</h4><p>I am surprised that he should have fled from one so lovely!</p>
          <h4>KAT.</h4><p>That's not true.</p>
          <h4>POOH.</h4><p>No!</p>
          <h4>KAT.</h4><p>
               You hold that I am not beautiful because my face is
               plain.  But you know nothing; you are still unenlightened.
               Learn, then, that it is not in the face alone that beauty is to
               be sought.  My face is unattractive!
          </p>
          <h4>POOH.</h4><p>It is.</p>
          <h4>KAT.</h4><p>  
               But I have a left shoulder-blade that is a miracle of
               loveliness.  People come miles to see it.  My right elbow has a
               fascination that few can resist.
          </p>
          <h4>POOH.</h4><p>  Allow me!</p>
          <h4>KAT.</h4><p>
               It is on view Tuesdays and Fridays, on presentation of
               visiting card.  As for my circulation, it is the largest in the
               world.
          </p>
          <h4>KO.</h4><p>  And yet he fled!</p>
          <h4>MIK.</h4><p>  And is now masquerading   in this town, disguised as a Second Trombone.</p>
          <h4>KO., POOH., and PITTI.</h4><p>  A Second Trombone!</p>
          <h4>MIK.</h4><p>  Yes; would it be troubling you too much if I asked you to produce him?  He goes by the name of——</p>
          <h4>KAT.</h4><p>  Nanki-Poo.</p>
          <h4>MIK.</h4><p>  Nanki-Poo.</p>
          <h4>KO.</h4><p>  It's quite easy.  That is, it's rather difficult.  In point of fact, he's gone abroad!</p>
          <h4>MIK.</h4><p>Gone abroad!  His address.</p>
          <h4>KO.</h4><p>Knightsbridge!</p>
          <h4>KAT.</h4><p>(who is reading certificate of death).</p><p>Ha!</p>
          <h4>MIK.</h4><p>What's the matter?</p>
          <h4>KAT.</h4><p>See here—his name—Nanki-Poo—beheaded this morning. Oh, where shall I find another?  Where shall I find another?</p>

          <p>[Ko-Ko, Pooh-Bah, and Pitti-Sing fall on their knees]</p>
